2025-04-23 21:12:44,182 - DEBUG - API response: **Medical History Summary: Patient_2**  

**Early Medical History**  
Patient_2’s complex medical history includes congenital and acquired conditions. Moyamoya disease, a rare cerebrovascular disorder, was confirmed via cerebral angiogram, demonstrating middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. This likely contributed to subsequent neurological risks. Airway complications emerged early, including tracheomalacia and tracheal stenosis, leading to recurrent interventions: neck exploration, tracheostomy, and multiple bronchoscopies. A tracheal metallic stent was placed and later removed due to complications, followed by distal tracheal dilation and placement of a Shiley tracheostomy tube.  

**Cardiovascular and Respiratory Conditions**  
Concurrent cardiac anomalies include aortic valve stenosis, mitral regurgitation, and patent foramen ovale (PFO). Pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) was later identified, complicating respiratory management. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is suspected, prompting plans for polysomnography and a CPAP trial with a tracheostomy-compatible mask.  

**Neurological Developments**  
New-onset generalized epilepsy was recently diagnosed, with levetiracetam initiated at 250 mg BID, titrating to 500 mg BID. An EEG and MRI brain are pending to evaluate seizure etiology and assess Moyamoya progression.  

**Social History**  
Patient_2 is a retired engineer, married, with no smoking history and rare alcohol use. Weight maintenance counseling was provided to mitigate cardiopulmonary strain.  

**Treatment Plans**  
Key interventions include ongoing seizure management with levetiracetam, airway maintenance via tracheostomy, and optimization of cardiopulmonary health. Parents were educated on seizure safety. Further workup aims to clarify OSA severity and refine neurological and cardiovascular care.  

**Summary**  
This patient’s history reflects multisystem involvement, requiring coordinated care for Moyamoya disease, complex airway pathology, valvular heart disease, and epilepsy. Prioritized plans focus on diagnostic clarity, symptom control, and preventive strategies to reduce complications.

Patient_2, a retired engineer, has a complex medical history involving congenital and acquired conditions. Moyamoya disease, diagnosed via cerebral angiogram demonstrating middle cerebral artery occlusion, underlies chronic cerebrovascular risks. Early airway complications (tracheomalacia, stenosis) prompted tracheostomy, multiple bronchoscopies, and a tracheal metallic stent placement (later removed due to complications), followed by distal tracheal dilation and Shiley tracheostomy tube. Concurrent congenital cardiac anomalies include aortic valve stenosis, mitral regurgitation, and patent foramen ovale. Pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) subsequently developed, complicating respiratory management.  

Recently diagnosed generalized epilepsy is managed with levetiracetam (titrated to 500 mg BID), with pending EEG and MRI to evaluate seizure etiology and Moyamoya progression. Suspected obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) warrants polysomnography and a tracheostomy-compatible CPAP trial.  

Social history notes marriage, no tobacco use, rare alcohol consumption, and weight management counseling. No known drug allergies.  

Current care prioritizes seizure control, airway maintenance via tracheostomy, and cardiopulmonary optimization. Family members were educated on seizure safety. Ongoing objectives include clarifying OSA severity, monitoring neurological/cardiovascular status, and implementing preventive strategies to mitigate complications through multidisciplinary coordination.

2025-04-24 16:15:38,730 - DEBUG - API response: Patient_2 is a retired engineer with a complex medical history, including epilepsy, Moyamoya disease, and tracheal pathology. Diagnosed with new-onset generalized epilepsy in early adulthood, he is managed with levetiracetam 250 mg BID (to be titrated) and received seizure safety education. Subsequently, he developed Moyamoya disease, complicated by an acute ischemic event and cognitive dysfunction. EEG and MRI are planned to evaluate disease progression and seizure etiology.  

Following this, he developed severe subglottic tracheal stenosis and tracheomalacia, requiring neck exploration, tracheostomy, bronchoscopy, tracheal stent removal, dilation, and Shiley tracheostomy tube placement. Post-procedural findings included stent-related granulation and inflammation. Concurrently, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is suspected, with polysomnography ordered and a tracheostomy-compatible CPAP trial pending results.  

Cardiovascular comorbidities include aortic valve stenosis, mitral regurgitation, pulmonary hypertension, patent foramen ovale, and hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function, necessitating ongoing surveillance.  

Social history: Nonsmoker, rare alcohol use, married, retired. No known allergies. Family history is unremarkable.  

Management priorities:  
1. **Neurology**: Titrate levetiracetam, monitor seizure frequency, and reassess in 4 weeks.  
2. **Respiratory**: Optimize tracheostomy care, pursue OSA management, and counsel on weight maintenance to reduce airway strain.  
3. **Cardiovascular**: Monitor valvular function and pulmonary hypertension.  

Multidisciplinary coordination is critical to address seizure control, airway stability, and cardiopulmonary risk mitigation.

**Conditions & Timeline**  
**Scoliosis**: Diagnosed following identification of a mild right thoracic curvature on forward bend test, confirmed by X-ray (15-degree Cobb angle). Management includes monitoring via spinal X-rays every 6 months, physical therapy for core strengthening, and potential bracing if progression exceeds 20 degrees.  

**Hypothyroidism**: Diagnosed with elevated TSH (6.5 mIU/L) and low free T4 (0.8 ng/dL). Initiated on levothyroxine 50 mcg daily, with plans to reassess thyroid function in 6 weeks.  

**Hypertension**: Sustained elevated blood pressure (average 150/90 mmHg) led to amlodipine 5 mg daily. Additional counseling on lifestyle modifications (low-sodium diet, exercise), with BP rechecks in 4 weeks and a metabolic panel in 2 weeks.  

**Osteoporosis**: Postmenopausal osteoporosis evidenced by low-impact right distal radius fracture and DEXA T-scores (-2.6 lumbar spine, -2.5 femoral neck). Family history significant for maternal osteoporosis. Treated with alendronate 70 mg weekly, calcium (1200 mg/day), and vitamin D (1000 IU/day). Referred to physical therapy for fall prevention.  

**Cardiac Findings**: Echocardiogram revealed trace mitral and tricuspid regurgitation with preserved ejection fraction (60%). No immediate intervention required.  

**Medications**:  
- Levothyroxine 50 mcg daily  
- Amlodipine 5 mg daily  
- Alendronate 70 mg weekly  
- Calcium 1200 mg + Vitamin D 1000 IU daily  

**Social History**: Nonsmoker, consumes alcohol occasionally (2–3 drinks/month), widowed, retired.  

**Family History**: Mother with osteoporosis.  

**Follow-Up Plans**:  
1. Scoliosis: Repeat spinal imaging in 6 months.  
2. Hypothyroidism: TSH/free T4 recheck in 6 weeks.  
3. Hypertension: BP monitoring and CMP in 2–4 weeks.  
4. Osteoporosis: DEXA follow-up in 3 months.  

**Clinical Significance**: Focus on preventing progression of scoliosis and osteoporosis, optimizing thyroid and BP control, and mitigating fracture risk through multidisciplinary care.

Patient_5 is a postmenopausal female with a history of scoliosis, hypothyroidism, hypertension, and osteoporosis. Scoliosis was diagnosed following identification of a mild right thoracic curvature (15° Cobb angle) on X-ray. Management includes biannual spinal imaging, physical therapy for core strengthening, and potential bracing if progression exceeds 20°. Hypothyroidism, confirmed by elevated TSH (6.5 mIU/L) and low free T4 (0.8 ng/dL), is managed with levothyroxine 50 mcg daily, with repeat thyroid function testing in 6 weeks.  

Hypertension, with sustained blood pressure averaging 150/90 mmHg, is treated with amlodipine 5 mg daily and lifestyle modifications (low-sodium diet, exercise). Blood pressure and comprehensive metabolic panel monitoring are planned in 2–4 weeks. Postmenopausal osteoporosis was diagnosed after a low-impact right distal radius fracture and DEXA T-scores of -2.6 (lumbar spine) and -2.5 (femoral neck). Treatment includes alendronate 70 mg weekly, calcium (1200 mg/day), vitamin D (1000 IU/day), and physical therapy for fall prevention. Family history is notable for maternal osteoporosis.  

Echocardiogram revealed trace mitral and tricuspid regurgitation with preserved ejection fraction (60%), requiring no intervention. Current medications: levothyroxine, amlodipine, alendronate, calcium, and vitamin D. Social history: nonsmoker, occasional alcohol (2–3 drinks/month), widowed, retired.  

Follow-up includes repeat spinal imaging (6 months), thyroid labs (6 weeks), BP/CMP (2–4 weeks), and DEXA (3 months). Management prioritizes preventing scoliosis/osteoporosis progression, optimizing thyroid and BP control, and mitigating fracture risk through multidisciplinary care.

Patient_2 is a retired engineer with a complex medical history. Key conditions and interventions are outlined chronologically below:  

**Early Adulthood/Unspecified Timeline**:  
- **Moyamoya disease** was diagnosed, characterized by ischemic events requiring ongoing monitoring. This rare cerebrovascular disorder likely contributed to later neurological risks.  
- **Patent foramen ovale (PFO)**, a congenital cardiac anomaly, was identified (exact timing unspecified).  

**Surgical Interventions (Timeline Unspecified, Likely Mid-Adulthood)**:  
- Underwent **neck exploration, tracheostomy, bronchoscopy, foreign body removal, and tracheal dilation** for **subglottic tracheal stenosis**, possibly secondary to prior intubation or stent-related granulation tissue. Later required **tracheostomy revision with stent removal** due to complications.  

**Cardiovascular Conditions**:  
- Developed **aortic valve stenosis**, **mitral regurgitation**, and **pulmonary hypertension**, necessitating cardiac surveillance. The PFO may contribute to hemodynamic stress, though no explicit link is documented.  

**Recent Developments**:  
- **New-onset generalized epilepsy** prompted initiation of **levetiracetam**, with plans for EEG and MRI to evaluate seizure etiology.  
- **Suspected obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)** led to recommendations for polysomnography and a CPAP trial, potentially linked to tracheal stenosis or obesity (not explicitly stated).  

**Social History**:  
- Nonsmoker, rare alcohol use, married. No reported drug use.  

**Allergies/Medications**:  
- No known drug allergies. Current regimen includes levetiracetam for seizure control.  

**Key Ongoing Plans**:  
1. **Neurological**: Titrate levetiracetam; monitor seizure activity.  
2. **Respiratory**: Optimize tracheostomy site; address OSA.  
3. **Cardiac**: Serial echocardiograms and clinical monitoring for valvular and pulmonary hypertension progression.  

**Family History**: Not documented.  

This history reflects multifactorial challenges, including cerebrovascular, respiratory, and cardiac pathologies, requiring coordinated multidisciplinary care.

2025-05-01 16:53:39,569 - DEBUG - API response: **Medical History Summary: Patient_2**  

Patient_2 is a retired engineer with no significant early medical history. In adulthood, they developed **generalized epilepsy**, managed with **levetiracetam** (initially 250 mg BID, increased to 500 mg BID). No family history of seizures or cardiovascular disease was reported.  

Subsequently, **moyamoya disease** was diagnosed after an **old lacunar infarct with acute ischemic event**, prompting plans for a **cerebral angiogram**. Concurrently, **tracheal stenosis** led to **airway obstruction** due to foreign body/stent material, requiring **neck exploration, tracheostomy, dilation, and tracheostomy tube placement**. **Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)** was suspected, with plans for a **sleep study (tracheostomy protocol)** and potential **CPAP trial**.  

Cardiovascular evaluation revealed **mild aortic valve stenosis, mild mitral regurgitation, pulmonary artery hypertension, and a patent foramen ovale**; ventricular function remained hyperdynamic.  

**Social History:** Married, no smoking, rare alcohol use.  
**Allergies:** None.  

**Key Plans:**  
1. **Neurologic:** EEG and MRI brain for epilepsy; seizure follow-up in 4 weeks.  
2. **Vascular:** Cerebral angiogram for moyamoya evaluation.  
3. **Respiratory:** Sleep study and CPAP assessment; follow-up in 6 weeks.  

**Summary:** Patient_2 has a complex multisystem history involving epilepsy, moyamoya disease, tracheal stenosis, and cardiovascular abnormalities, necessitating coordinated care for seizure control, vascular assessment, and respiratory support.

Patient_2 is a retired engineer with a complex medical history. Key conditions include **Moyamoya disease**, first presenting with an **acute ischemic event**, and **generalized epilepsy** of recent onset. Chronic **tracheal stenosis** and **traracheomalacia** necessitated multiple surgical interventions, including **neck exploration, tracheostomy, bronchoscopy, removal of a tracheal metallic stent, tracheal dilation, and placement of a Shiley tracheostomy tube** to address airway obstruction. These procedures were likely performed sequentially to manage progressive respiratory compromise.  

Cardiovascular abnormalities include **mild aortic valve stenosis**, **mitral regurgitation**, **pulmonary artery hypertension**, and a **patent foramen ovale**, which may contribute to hemodynamic instability. **Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)** is suspected, with plans for polysomnography and a potential CPAP trial.  

In the neurological domain, **new-onset generalized epilepsy** prompted initiation of **levetiracetam** (current sole medication) and an EEG/MRI to evaluate seizure etiology. Cognitive dysfunction, potentially linked to Moyamoya-related cerebrovascular changes, is noted.  

**Social history**: Nonsmoker, rare alcohol use, married. No known drug allergies. Family history is unremarkable.  

**Key plans** focus on neurology (seizure control, imaging, safety education), cardiopulmonary management (sleep study, weight maintenance counseling), and longitudinal follow-up. The interplay of Moyamoya vasculopathy, airway pathology, and cardiac comorbidities underscores the need for multidisciplinary care to mitigate complications.

2025-05-08 15:18:12,652 - DEBUG - API response: **Patient_1 Medical History Summary**  

**Early Life to Adolescence:**  
Patient_1 developed childhood-onset asthma and seasonal allergies, managed with albuterol (rescue inhaler) and cetirizine. They remained a nonsmoker, with minimal alcohol use. Family history includes cardiovascular risks: grandparents with heart disease and a grandmother with diabetes and stroke.  

**Young Adulthood (20s–30s):**  
Obesity emerged as a significant concern, contributing to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), managed with omeprazole. Despite lifestyle efforts, weight persisted, prompting a laparoscopic gastric bypass in their early 30s. Post-surgery, GERD symptoms improved, though occasional reflux required continued proton pump inhibitor therapy.  

**Mid-Adulthood (40s–50s):**  
Metabolic complications arose, including hyperlipidemia, addressed with atorvastatin. Bilateral knee osteoarthritis developed, likely secondary to chronic obesity, with reports of knee discomfort, limited range of motion, and reliance on NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen) for pain management. Assessments confirmed bilateral wheezing (controlled with Flovent) and elevated cholesterol.  

**Social & Ongoing Management:**  
Patient_1 remains single, with no occupational hazards reported. Current care focuses on multidisciplinary management: nutritionist referrals for weight maintenance, physical therapy for knee mobility, and regular lipid/glucose monitoring. Imaging (knee X-rays, upper GI studies) and H. pylori testing were ordered to refine GERD and osteoarthritis management. Asthma and allergy control emphasizes trigger avoidance, with Flovent and cetirizine continued.  

**Allergies:** Penicillin.  
**Key Plans:** Reinforce diet/exercise, NSAID monitoring, and evaluate potential laparoscopic gastric banding if weight rebounds.  

This history highlights a progression of obesity-related comorbidities, managed through pharmacological and lifestyle interventions, with family history underscoring cardiovascular and metabolic risks.

**Early Life:** Childhood-onset asthma and allergic rhinitis managed with albuterol and cetirizine. Lifelong nonsmoker with minimal alcohol use. Family history significant for cardiovascular disease (paternal grandparents), maternal grandmother with type 2 diabetes and stroke.  

**Young Adulthood (20s–30s):** Obesity developed, contributing to GERD treated with omeprazole. Underwent laparoscopic gastric bypass at age 32, resulting in improved GERD symptoms; intermittent PPI use continued.  

**Mid-Adulthood (40s–50s):** Diagnosed with hyperlipidemia (atorvastatin) and bilateral knee osteoarthritis secondary to obesity. Chronic knee pain managed with NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen) and physical therapy. Asthma remains controlled with Flovent; no recent exacerbations.  

**Current Status (50s):** Single, no occupational exposures. Multidisciplinary care includes nutritionist-guided weight maintenance, physical therapy for joint mobility, and routine lipid/glucose monitoring. Recent imaging (knee X-rays, upper GI series) and *H. pylori* testing pending to refine GERD and osteoarthritis management. Allergies: Penicillin (rash).  

**Key Plans:** Reinforce lifestyle modifications, monitor NSAID-related renal/GI risks, and consider laparoscopic gastric banding if weight recurrence occurs.  

This history reflects progressive obesity-related comorbidities, managed through surgical, pharmacological, and lifestyle interventions, with a family background underscoring metabolic and cardiovascular risk vigilance.

**Early History**: Patient_2’s medical history is marked by multiple complex conditions. Moyamoya disease, a cerebrovascular disorder, was diagnosed following MRI findings, likely contributing to neurological risks. Concurrently, subglottic tracheal stenosis and tracheomalacia necessitated repeated surgical interventions, including neck exploration, tracheostomy, bronchoscopy, tracheal stent removal, dilation, and tracheostomy tube placement. These procedures addressed airway compromise and stent-related granulation tissue.  

**Cardiovascular and Respiratory Comorbidities**: Later evaluations revealed aortic valve stenosis with calcification, mitral regurgitation with annular calcification, and pulmonary artery hypertension, suggesting progressive cardiac pathology. A patent foramen ovale (PFO) was also identified. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) was suspected clinically, prompting plans for polysomnography and CPAP trial.  

**Recent Developments**: Patient_2 developed new-onset generalized epilepsy, leading to initiation of levetiracetam, with titration planned. An EEG and repeat MRI are pending to evaluate seizure etiology and monitor moyamoya progression.  

**Medications**: Levetiracetam (antiepileptic).  
**Allergies**: None reported.  
**Social History**: Retired engineer, married, nonsmoker, rare alcohol use.  
**Family History**: Not documented.  

**Key Plans**:  
- Neurological: EEG/MRI for epilepsy and moyamoya surveillance.  
- Respiratory: Polysomnography for OSA confirmation; CPAP trial.  
- Cardiac: Ongoing monitoring for valvular and pulmonary hypertension management.  

This history reflects a multifaceted profile with neurological, respiratory, and cardiovascular interplay, necessitating multidisciplinary care.

**Early Childhood to Adolescence:**  
Patient_1 developed asthma and seasonal allergies in childhood, managed with **albuterol** (rescue inhaler) and **cetirizine** (antihistamine). No surgeries or hospitalizations reported during this period.  

**Adulthood (20s–30s):**  
Obesity emerged as a chronic condition, contributing to fatigue and joint stress. By their 30s, **gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)** was diagnosed, treated with **omeprazole**. A **laparoscopic gastric bypass** was performed in their mid-30s to address obesity and related comorbidities. Post-surgery, GERD symptoms improved with continued proton pump inhibitor therapy.  

**Later Adulthood (40s–present):**  
Persistent obesity and mechanical stress led to **bilateral knee osteoarthritis**, with symptoms of swelling, tenderness, and pain managed by **ibuprofen** and **naproxen** (NSAIDs). **Hyperlipidemia** was identified, prompting initiation of **atorvastatin** and dietary counseling. Recent assessments noted bilateral wheezing (asthma exacerbation), requiring **Flovent** (inhaled corticosteroid) alongside albuterol.  

**Medications & Allergies:**  
Current medications include albuterol, Flovent, cetirizine, omeprazole, atorvastatin, and NSAIDs. Allergy to **penicillin** is documented.

**Conditions & Timeline**  
Patient_2’s medical history is marked by complex multisystem involvement. In early adulthood, they were diagnosed with **Moyamoya disease**, a rare cerebrovascular disorder, which led to ischemic events requiring ongoing neurological monitoring. Concurrently, **tracheomalacia** and **severe subglottic tracheal stenosis** necessitated multiple interventions, including **tracheostomy tube placement**, **tracheal dilation**, and **removal of a tracheal stent** (procedures performed sequentially, though exact ages unspecified).  

Cardiovascular abnormalities emerged later, including **aortic valve stenosis**, **mitral regurgitation**, **mitral annular calcification**, and **pulmonary artery hypertension**, alongside a **patent foramen ovale** (PFO). Most recently, **generalized epilepsy** was diagnosed following new-onset seizures, prompting neurological evaluation.  

**Treatments & Surgeries**  
Surgical history focuses on airway management: **neck exploration**, **bronchoscopy**, and repeated tracheal procedures. Current cardiac conditions are managed conservatively, with no reported surgical interventions.  

**Medications**  
- **Levetiracetam**: Initiated for seizure control, with plans for dose titration.  

**Allergies**  
- No known drug or environmental allergies.  

**Social History**  
- Nonsmoker; rare alcohol use.  
- Married; retired engineer.  

**Family History**  
- No significant family medical history reported.  

**Key Assessments**  
1. **Neurological**: Moyamoya-related ischemia; epilepsy evaluation pending EEG/MRI.  
2. **Respiratory**: Severe tracheal stenosis managed via tracheostomy; polysomnography planned to assess for sleep apnea, with CPAP trial.  
3. **Cardiac**: Multivalvular disease and pulmonary hypertension under surveillance.  

**Care Plans**  
- Optimize seizure control with Levetiracetam.  
- Address sleep-disordered breathing and tracheostomy care.  
- Monitor cardiac and cerebrovascular progression.  

This history reflects a complex interplay of chronic conditions requiring multidisciplinary management.

Cardiovascular abnormalities emerged later, including **aortic stenosis**, **mitral regurgitation with annular calcification**, **pulmonary hypertension**, and a **patent foramen ovale**, all managed conservatively. Recently, new-onset seizures led to a diagnosis of **generalized epilepsy**, with levetiracetam initiated for seizure control.  

**Surgical History**: Airway procedures (tracheostomy, dilations, stent removal), neck exploration, and bronchoscopies.  

**Current Medications**:  
- Levetiracetam (titrating dose).  

**Allergies**: None reported.  

**Social**: Nonsmoker, rare alcohol use, married.  

**Key Assessments/Plans**:  
1. **Neurological**: EEG/MRI to evaluate epilepsy; monitor Moyamoya progression.  
2. **Respiratory**: Polysomnography for suspected sleep apnea; CPAP trial pending.  
3. **Cardiac**: Surveillance of valvular disease and pulmonary hypertension.  

Multidisciplinary coordination is prioritized to address chronic disease progression, optimize airway management, and mitigate neurological and cardiovascular risks.

Cerebral angiogram confirmed occlusion of left and right MCA with collaterals. Diagnosed with moyamoya disease. Neuropsychologic testing showed cognitive dysfunction and impaired language. Discharged on levetiracetam 500 mg BID, no additional medications.\n\nRecord 3 (Age 40):\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Airway obstruction secondary to severe subglottic tracheal stenosis with foreign body in the trachea. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Airway obstruction secondary to severe subglottic tracheal stenosis with foreign body in the trachea. OPERATION PERFORMED: Neck exploration; tracheostomy; urgent flexible bronchoscopy via tracheostomy site; removal of foreign body, tracheal metallic stent material; dilation distal trachea; placement of #8 Shiley single cannula tracheostomy tube. INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY: The patient is a 40-year-old male with history of progressive tracheomalacia, treated with a tracheal metallic stent 5 years ago with temporary improvement. He developed progressive airway obstruction and was admitted for evaluation. Bronchoscopy showed extensive subglottic and distal tracheal stenosis secondary to stent-related granulation and inflammation. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Moyamoya disease, epilepsy. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: None. SOCIAL HISTORY: Married, nonsmoker, rare alcohol use. FAMILY HISTORY: Unremarkable. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Levetiracetam 500 mg BID. ALLERGIES: None.

He reports loud snoring, witnessed apneas, and daytime fatigue, worsened since tracheostomy for tracheal stenosis. His moyamoya disease and epilepsy are stable. No significant weight gain or alcohol use. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Moyamoya disease, epilepsy, tracheomalacia with tracheal stenosis. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Tracheostomy with stent removal. SOCIAL HISTORY: Married, nonsmoker, rare alcohol use, retired engineer. FAMILY HISTORY: Unremarkable. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Levetiracetam 500 mg BID. ALLERGIES: None. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure 125/75, pulse 80, temperature 98.5°F, weight 180 pounds, height 5’10”. GENERAL: Alert, oriented, no distress. HEENT: Tracheostomy site patent, Mallampati class II. LUNGS: Clear with tracheostomy. HEART: Regular rhythm, no murmurs. NEUROLOGICAL: Stable right facial weakness. ASSESSMENT: 1. Suspected obstructive sleep apnea, related to airway anatomy and tracheostomy. 2. Moyamoya disease and epilepsy, stable. PLAN: Order polysomnography with tracheostomy protocol. Discuss CPAP trial with tracheostomy-compatible mask. Counsel on weight maintenance. Follow up in 6 weeks after sleep study.\n\nRecord 5 (Age 70):\n1. The left ventricular cavity size and wall thickness appear normal. The wall motion and left ventricular systolic function appears hyperdynamic with estimated ejection fraction of 70% to 75%. There is near-cavity obliteration seen. There also appears to be increased left ventricular outflow tract gradient at the mid cavity level consistent with hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function. There is abnormal left ventricular relaxation pattern seen as well as elevated left atrial pressures seen by Doppler examination. 2. The left atrium appears mildly dilated. 3. The right atrium and right ventricle appear normal. 4. The aortic root appears normal. 5. The aortic valve appears calcified with mild aortic valve stenosis, calculated aortic valve area is 1.3 cm square with a maximum instantaneous gradient of 34 and a mean gradient of 19 mm. 6. There is mitral annular calcification extending to leaflets and supportive structures with thickening of mitral valve leaflets with mild mitral regurgitation. 7. The tricuspid valve appears normal with trace tricuspid regurgitation with moderate pulmonary artery hypertension. Estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is 49 mmHg. Estimated right atrial pressure of 10 mmHg. 8. The pulmonary valve appears normal with trace pulmonary insufficiency. 9. There is no pericardial effusion or intracardiac mass seen. 10. There is a color Doppler suggestive of a patent foramen ovale with lipomatous hypertrophy of the interatrial septum. 11. The study was somewhat technically limited and hence subtle abnormalities could be missed from the study.\n'}], 'model': 'gpt-3.5-turbo', 'max_tokens': 4096, 'temperature': 0.7}}

He apparently recovered within 24 hours. For two weeks prior to presentation he demonstrated emotional lability, uncharacteristic of him (outbursts of anger and inappropriate laughter). He left a stove on. He began slurring his speech 2 days prior to admission. On the day of presentation he developed right facial weakness and began stumbling to the right. He denied any associated headache, nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, neck stiffness or visual change. There was no history of illicit drug/ETOH use or head trauma. PMH: Epilepsy diagnosed at age 8, controlled. FHX: Unremarkable. SHX: Single, lives with partner, nonsmoker, rare alcohol use. ROS: None. EXAM: BP118/66. HR83. RR 20. T36.8C. MS: Alert and oriented to name only. Perseverative thought processes. Utilized one or two word answers/phrases. Non-fluent. Rarely followed commands. Impaired writing of name. CN: Flattened right nasolabial fold. Motor: Mild weakness in RUE with pronator drift. Sensory: Intact to noxious stimulation. Coordination: Difficult to assess. Station: Right pronator drift. Gait: Unremarkable. Reflexes: 2/2BUE, 3/3BLE, plantars flexor bilaterally. INITIAL STUDIES: CBC, GS, UA, PT, PTT, ESR, CRP, EKG unremarkable. HCT showed hypodensities in right putamen, left caudate, and subcortical locations. COURSE: MRI Brain Scan revealed old lacunar infarct in right basal ganglia, edema in left caudate nucleus suggesting acute ischemic event, arterial enhancement of left MCA suggesting slow flow, consistent with moyamoya disease. Cerebral angiogram confirmed occlusion of left and right MCA with collaterals. Diagnosed with moyamoya disease. Neuropsychologic testing showed cognitive dysfunction and impaired language. Discharged on levetiracetam 500 mg BID, no additional medications.\n\nRecord 3 (Age 40):\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Airway obstruction secondary to severe subglottic tracheal stenosis with foreign body in the trachea. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Airway obstruction secondary to severe subglottic tracheal stenosis with foreign body in the trachea. OPERATION PERFORMED: Neck exploration; tracheostomy; urgent flexible bronchoscopy via tracheostomy site; removal of foreign body, tracheal metallic stent material; dilation distal trachea; placement of #8 Shiley single cannula tracheostomy tube. INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY: The patient is a 40-year-old male with history of progressive tracheomalacia, treated with a tracheal metallic stent 5 years ago with temporary improvement. He developed progressive airway obstruction and was admitted for evaluation. Bronchoscopy showed extensive subglottic and distal tracheal stenosis secondary to stent-related granulation and inflammation. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Moyamoya disease, epilepsy. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: None. SOCIAL HISTORY: Married, nonsmoker, rare alcohol use. FAMILY HISTORY: Unremarkable. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Levetiracetam 500 mg BID. ALLERGIES: None. PROCEDURE: Under general anesthesia, neck exploration and tracheostomy were performed. Bronchoscopy removed stent material, and distal trachea was dilated. A #8 Shiley tracheostomy tube was placed. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to recovery in stable condition.\n\nRecord 4 (Age 55):\nHISTORY: The patient is a 55-year-old male referred for suspected obstructive sleep apnea. He reports loud snoring, witnessed apneas, and daytime fatigue, worsened since tracheostomy for tracheal stenosis. His moyamoya disease and epilepsy are stable. No significant weight gain or alcohol use. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Moyamoya disease, epilepsy, tracheomalacia with tracheal stenosis. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Tracheostomy with stent removal. SOCIAL HISTORY: Married, nonsmoker, rare alcohol use, retired engineer. FAMILY HISTORY: Unremarkable. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Levetiracetam 500 mg BID. ALLERGIES: None. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure 125/75, pulse 80, temperature 98.5°F, weight 180 pounds, height 5’10”. GENERAL: Alert, oriented, no distress. HEENT: Tracheostomy site patent, Mallampati class II. LUNGS: Clear with tracheostomy. HEART: Regular rhythm, no murmurs. NEUROLOGICAL: Stable right facial weakness. ASSESSMENT: 1. Suspected obstructive sleep apnea, related to airway anatomy and tracheostomy. 2. Moyamoya disease and epilepsy, stable. PLAN: Order polysomnography with tracheostomy protocol. Discuss CPAP trial with tracheostomy-compatible mask. Counsel on weight maintenance. Follow up in 6 weeks after sleep study.\n\nRecord 5 (Age 70):\n1. The left ventricular cavity size and wall thickness appear normal. The wall motion and left ventricular systolic function appears hyperdynamic with estimated ejection fraction of 70% to 75%. There is near-cavity obliteration seen. There also appears to be increased left ventricular outflow tract gradient at the mid cavity level consistent with hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function. There is abnormal left ventricular relaxation pattern seen as well as elevated left atrial pressures seen by Doppler examination. 2. The left atrium appears mildly dilated. 3. The right atrium and right ventricle appear normal. 4. The aortic root appears normal. 5. The aortic valve appears calcified with mild aortic valve stenosis, calculated aortic valve area is 1.3 cm square with a maximum instantaneous gradient of 34 and a mean gradient of 19 mm. 6. There is mitral annular calcification extending to leaflets and supportive structures with thickening of mitral valve leaflets with mild mitral regurgitation. 7. The tricuspid valve appears normal with trace tricuspid regurgitation with moderate pulmonary artery hypertension. Estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is 49 mmHg. Estimated right atrial pressure of 10 mmHg. 8. The pulmonary valve appears normal with trace pulmonary insufficiency. 9. There is no pericardial effusion or intracardiac mass seen. 10. There is a color Doppler suggestive of a patent foramen ovale with lipomatous hypertrophy of the interatrial septum. 11. The study was somewhat technically limited and hence subtle abnormalities could be missed from the study.\n'}], 'model': 'gpt-3.5-turbo', 'max_tokens': 4096, 'temperature': 0.7}}

- **Age 10**: You had asthma and seasonal allergies, with symptoms like wheezing and coughing, especially at night or around dust. You were prescribed an albuterol inhaler (for sudden asthma symptoms) and Flovent (to control asthma long-term), along with cetirizine for allergies. You were allergic to penicillin (causes a rash).  

- **Age 20**: You were diagnosed with obesity (BMI 36) and reported fatigue and knee pain. Your asthma was under control with inhalers. A nutritionist was recommended for weight loss, along with exercise and lab tests to check for metabolic issues.  

- **Age 30**: Your weight increased to 312 pounds, causing difficulty with daily activities. You explored weight-loss support groups and considered laparoscopic gastric banding (a weight-loss surgery). Tests were ordered to prepare for potential surgery.  

- **Age 45**: After gastric bypass surgery, you lost weight (from 312 to 200 lbs) but regained some. You were diagnosed with high cholesterol and started on atorvastatin. Asthma and GERD (acid reflux) were stable. You were advised to follow a heart-healthy diet and exercise.  

- **Age 60**: You developed knee pain and stiffness due to osteoarthritis, likely from past obesity. Your weight was 210 lbs post-surgery. You were prescribed naproxen for pain and referred to physical therapy. Asthma, high cholesterol, and GERD remained managed.  

**Key Details**:  
- **Diagnoses**: Asthma, seasonal allergies, obesity, GERD, high cholesterol, knee osteoarthritis.  
- **Medications**: Flovent, albuterol, cetirizine, omeprazole, atorvastatin, naproxen (as needed).  
- **Allergies**: Penicillin (rash).  
- **Surgeries**: Laparoscopic gastric bypass (for weight loss).  
- **Lifestyle**: Former light smoker (quit at 55), minimal alcohol, history of weight struggles.  

**Recommended Specialist**: Rheumatologist (for osteoarthritis management).

2025-06-04 19:59:59,145 - DEBUG - API response: **Medical History Summary for Patient_1:**

- **Age 10**: Diagnosed with asthma and seasonal allergies after experiencing wheezing and coughing, especially at night or around dust. Started using an albuterol inhaler as needed and Flovent (a daily inhaler) to control asthma, along with cetirizine for allergies. Allergic to penicillin (causes a rash). No surgeries. Healthy childhood otherwise.

- **Age 20**: Struggled with obesity (BMI 36, 220 lbs) and reported fatigue and knee pain. Asthma was under control with medications. Referred to a nutritionist for weight management and advised to exercise 150 minutes/week. No surgeries. Family history of heart disease and diabetes noted.

- **Age 30**: Severe obesity (312 lbs) with difficulty performing daily activities like climbing stairs. Explored weight loss support groups and considered laparoscopic gastric banding after evaluations. Continued asthma/allergy medications. Smoked lightly (<3 cigarettes/day) and drank minimally. No major health issues other than obesity.

- **Age 45**: Underwent gastric bypass surgery 15 years earlier, losing weight (down to 200 lbs) but regained 20 lbs. Diagnosed with high cholesterol (LDL 150 mg/dL) and started atorvastatin. Asthma and GERD were stable. Advised to follow a low-cholesterol diet and exercise.

- **Age 60**: Experienced worsening knee pain (likely osteoarthritis) due to long-term obesity, now weighing 210 lbs post-surgery. Managed with naproxen and physical therapy referrals. Quit smoking 5 years ago. Asthma, hyperlipidemia, and GERD remained controlled with medications.

**Key Ongoing Issues**: Obesity (post-bariatric surgery), asthma, seasonal allergies, GERD, high cholesterol, and knee osteoarthritis.  
**Allergies**: Penicillin (rash).  
**Medications**: Flovent, albuterol, cetirizine, omeprazole, atorvastatin, naproxen (as needed).  

**Recommended Specialist**: **Bariatrician or Endocrinologist** (for ongoing weight and metabolic management).

- **Age 10:** You had asthma and seasonal allergies, with symptoms like wheezing and coughing triggered by dust. You were prescribed an albuterol inhaler (for quick relief) and Flovent (for long-term control), along with cetirizine for allergies. You were advised to avoid dust mites.  

- **Age 20:** You were diagnosed with obesity (BMI 36) and reported fatigue and knee pain. Your asthma was under control with inhalers. A nutritionist was recommended for weight management, along with exercise and lab tests to screen for metabolic issues.  

- **Age 30:** You struggled with severe obesity (312 lbs) and difficulty with physical activities. You explored weight loss support groups and considered gastric banding surgery. Tests were ordered to evaluate your readiness for surgery.  

- **Age 45:** After gastric bypass surgery, you lost weight but regained some. You were diagnosed with high cholesterol and started on atorvastatin. Asthma and GERD remained stable. Lifestyle changes and follow-up labs were recommended.  

- **Age 60:** You developed knee osteoarthritis, likely due to past obesity. Your weight was stable post-surgery, and your asthma and cholesterol were managed. You were prescribed pain relief (naproxen), referred to physical therapy, and advised to monitor your weight.  

**Key Points:**  
- **Chronic Conditions:** Asthma, seasonal allergies, obesity (status post gastric bypass), GERD, high cholesterol, knee osteoarthritis.  
- **Medications:** Flovent, albuterol, cetirizine, omeprazole, atorvastatin, naproxen/ibuprofen.  
- **Allergies:** Penicillin (rash).  
- **Surgeries:** Laparoscopic gastric bypass.  
- **Lifestyle:** Former light smoker (quit at 55), minimal alcohol, history of weight struggles.  

**Recommended Specialist:** Rheumatologist (for knee osteoarthritis and long-term joint management).

- **Age 8**: You were diagnosed with epilepsy after having two seizures (each lasting 2–3 minutes) with no clear triggers. Started on levetiracetam (250 mg, later increased to 500 mg twice daily). Tests (EEG, MRI) were done to rule out other causes. No other health issues at this time.  

- **Age 25**: You developed confusion, slurred speech, and right-sided weakness after a flu-like illness. Tests revealed moyamoya disease (a rare condition affecting brain blood vessels) and an old stroke in the right basal ganglia. Levetiracetam was continued, and no additional medications were needed. Cognitive and language difficulties were noted.  

- **Age 40**: You had severe airway narrowing (tracheal stenosis) due to a previously placed tracheal stent. Underwent urgent surgery to remove the stent, dilate the trachea, and place a tracheostomy tube. Your moyamoya disease and epilepsy remained stable.  

- **Age 55**: You reported symptoms of sleep apnea (snoring, daytime fatigue), likely related to your tracheostomy. A sleep study was recommended. Moyamoya disease and epilepsy were still controlled with levetiracetam.  

- **Age 70**: A heart evaluation showed mild aortic valve stenosis, mild mitral regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary hypertension. Your heart function was otherwise strong, but some age-related changes were noted.  

**Key Details**:  
- **Diagnoses**: Epilepsy (since age 8), moyamoya disease (since age 25), tracheal stenosis (age 40), suspected sleep apnea (age 55), and mild heart valve issues (age 70).  
- **Medications**: Levetiracetam (500 mg twice daily) for epilepsy.  
- **Surgeries**: Tracheostomy with stent removal (age 40).  
- **Allergies**: None.  
- **Lifestyle**: Nonsmoker, rare alcohol use.  

**Recommended Specialist**: **Neurologist (for epilepsy and moyamoya disease monitoring)**.

- **Age 12:** You were diagnosed with seasonal allergies (allergic rhinitis) with symptoms like sneezing, nasal congestion, and itchy eyes, especially in spring. Started on cetirizine (antihistamine) and Flonase (nasal spray). Allergic to egg-based products (causes hives).  

- **Age 30:** Developed chronic sinusitis, with facial discomfort and nasal congestion. Continued allergic rhinitis. Treated with Veramyst (nasal spray), Medrol (steroid pack), and saline rinses. No surgeries.  

- **Age 45:** Began experiencing heartburn and regurgitation (GERD), likely linked to sinusitis. Started omeprazole (acid reducer) and advised lifestyle changes (e.g., avoiding trigger foods).  

- **Age 60:** New symptoms of shortness of breath and wheezing led to an asthma diagnosis, likely allergy-related. Started Flovent (inhaled steroid) and albuterol (rescue inhaler). Referred to a pulmonologist.  

- **Age 75:** Diagnosed with hypertension (high blood pressure), added lisinopril. Asthma, GERD, and sinusitis remained stable. Advised to reduce sodium intake.  

**Key Details:**  
- **Diagnoses:** Allergic rhinitis, chronic sinusitis, GERD, asthma, hypertension.  
- **Medications:** Cetirizine, Flonase/Veramyst, omeprazole, Flovent, albuterol, lisinopril.  
- **Allergies:** Egg-based products (hives).  
- **Surgeries:** None.  
- **Lifestyle:** Nonsmoker, minimal alcohol, high-sodium diet (later advised to reduce).

2025-06-04 20:17:20,799 - DEBUG - API response: **Medical History Summary for Patient_5:**  

- **Age 15**: You were diagnosed with mild scoliosis (a slight curvature of the spine) during a school screening. You had minor back pain but no other issues. A spinal X-ray showed a 15-degree curve. You were advised to do physical therapy for core strength and to monitor the scoliosis with follow-up X-rays.  

- **Age 30**: You developed hypothyroidism (an underactive thyroid), causing fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. Blood tests confirmed it, and you started levothyroxine (50 mcg daily) to manage it. Your scoliosis remained stable.  

- **Age 45**: You were diagnosed with high blood pressure (hypertension), with readings around 150/90 mmHg. You started amlodipine (5 mg daily) and were advised to eat less salt and exercise. Your hypothyroidism and scoliosis were stable.  

- **Age 60**: You fractured your wrist after a minor fall, and a bone scan revealed osteoporosis (weak bones). You started alendronate (70 mg weekly), calcium (1200 mg daily), and vitamin D (1000 IU daily) to strengthen your bones. Your blood pressure and thyroid levels were well-managed.  

- **Age 80**: Your heart function was normal, with no major issues. You continued medications for osteoporosis, hypothyroidism, and hypertension. Your overall health was stable.  

**Lifestyle Notes**: You’ve never smoked, drink alcohol rarely, and have a family history of osteoporosis (your mother had it).  

**Current Medications**:  
- Levothyroxine (75 mcg daily) for hypothyroidism  
- Amlodipine (5 mg daily) for blood pressure  
- Alendronate (70 mg weekly), calcium, and vitamin D for osteoporosis  

**Allergies**: None.  

**Recommended Specialist**: **Endocrinologist** (to manage hypothyroidism and osteoporosis).

2025-06-06 22:29:45,020 - DEBUG - API response: Here’s a summary of your medical history in simple terms:

**Age 10**: You had asthma and seasonal allergies, causing wheezing and coughing, especially at night or around dust. You were given an albuterol inhaler (for quick relief) and Flovent (daily inhaler), plus cetirizine for allergies. You were allergic to penicillin (causes a rash).

**Age 20**: You gained weight (220 lbs, BMI 36) and had mild knee pain and fatigue. Asthma was under control with inhalers. A nutritionist was recommended for weight loss, along with exercise and blood tests for metabolic health.

**Age 30**: Weight increased to 312 lbs, causing difficulty with daily activities. You tried support groups and considered gastric banding surgery. Tests were ordered to prepare for surgery, including heart and lung checks. You had GERD (acid reflux) and smoked lightly (<3 cigarettes/day).

**Age 45**: After gastric bypass surgery, you lost weight (from 312 to 200 lbs) but regained 20 lbs. High cholesterol was found, and you started atorvastatin. Asthma and GERD were stable. You were advised to eat healthier and exercise.

**Age 60**: You now have knee pain (likely arthritis) due to long-term obesity, though you’ve kept weight around 210 lbs post-surgery. You take atorvastatin for cholesterol, inhalers for asthma, and ibuprofen/naproxen for pain. Physical therapy was recommended for your knees.

**Key Points**:  
- **Diagnoses**: Asthma, seasonal allergies, obesity, GERD, high cholesterol, knee arthritis.  
- **Medications**: Flovent, albuterol, cetirizine, atorvastatin, omeprazole, pain relievers (ibuprofen/naproxen).  
- **Allergies**: Penicillin (rash).  
- **Surgeries**: Gastric bypass (~age 30).  
- **Lifestyle**: Former light smoker (quit at 55), minimal alcohol, history of weight struggles.  

**Recommended Specialist**: Rheumatologist (for knee osteoarthritis and joint pain).

- **Age 8**: You were diagnosed with epilepsy after experiencing two seizures. Tests (EEG and MRI) were done to confirm the cause. You started taking levetiracetam (250 mg, later increased to 500 mg twice daily) to control seizures. No other health issues were noted.  

- **Age 25**: You developed confusion, slurred speech, and right-sided weakness. Tests revealed moyamoya disease (a rare condition affecting brain blood vessels) and an old stroke in the right basal ganglia. Your epilepsy was stable, and you continued levetiracetam.  

- **Age 40**: You had severe airway narrowing (tracheal stenosis) due to a previous stent. Surgery was done to remove the stent, dilate your trachea, and place a tracheostomy tube to help you breathe.  

- **Age 55**: You developed symptoms of sleep apnea (snoring, daytime fatigue), likely related to your tracheostomy. A sleep study was recommended. Your moyamoya disease and epilepsy remained stable.  

- **Age 70**: A heart exam showed mild aortic valve stenosis, mitral valve thickening, and moderate lung artery high blood pressure (pulmonary hypertension). Your heart function was strong but with some abnormal relaxation patterns.  

**Key Points:**  
- **Diagnoses**: Epilepsy (since age 8), moyamoya disease (since age 25), tracheal stenosis (age 40), sleep apnea (age 55), and mild heart valve issues (age 70).  
- **Medications**: Levetiracetam (500 mg twice daily) for epilepsy.  
- **Surgeries**: Tracheostomy and stent removal (age 40).  
- **Allergies**: None.  
- **Lifestyle**: Nonsmoker, rare alcohol use, stable weight.  

**Recommended Specialist**: Neurologist (for epilepsy and moyamoya disease follow-up).

**Age 5**: You were diagnosed with Kawasaki disease, a condition causing fever, rash, and swelling. You received treatment with aspirin and IVIG (a special IV medication), and your symptoms resolved. A heart scan (echocardiogram) was normal. You were advised to avoid live vaccines for 11 months.  

**Age 15**: You developed asthma, with wheezing triggered by pollen. You were prescribed an albuterol inhaler for emergencies and Flovent (a daily inhaler) to control symptoms. Allergy medication (cetirizine) was also added.  

**Age 30**: You had surgery to remove four impacted wisdom teeth under general anesthesia. Your asthma was stable, and you were taking Flovent and albuterol as needed.  

**Age 45**: You were hospitalized with pneumonia (a lung infection) and treated with antibiotics. Your asthma was stable during this time. A follow-up with a lung specialist (pulmonologist) was recommended.  

**Age 65**: A recent heart scan showed normal heart function with no issues related to your childhood Kawasaki disease. Your asthma remains managed with Flovent and albuterol.  

**Key Points**:  
- **Diagnoses**: Resolved Kawasaki disease, asthma, pneumonia (once), impacted wisdom teeth.  
- **Medications**: Flovent (daily inhaler), albuterol (emergency inhaler), cetirizine (allergy pill).  
- **Surgeries**: Wisdom teeth removal at age 30.  
- **Allergies**: None reported.  
- **Lifestyle**: Nonsmoker, minimal alcohol, worked in IT.  

**Recommended Specialist**: Pulmonologist (for asthma management and any future lung concerns).

2025-06-08 14:18:08,204 - DEBUG - API response: **Medical History Summary for Patient_1:**

- **Age 10**: You were diagnosed with asthma and seasonal allergies, likely triggered by dust. You had wheezing and coughing, especially at night. You started using an albuterol inhaler as needed and Flovent (a daily inhaler) to manage asthma, along with cetirizine for allergies. You had no other major health issues.

- **Age 20**: You gained weight (BMI 36) and reported fatigue and knee pain. Your asthma was under control with inhalers. You were referred to a nutritionist for weight management and advised to exercise regularly. Screening for metabolic issues (like diabetes) was recommended.

- **Age 30**: You struggled with obesity (312 lbs) and had difficulty with physical activities like climbing stairs. You explored weight-loss support groups and considered gastric banding surgery. Tests were ordered to evaluate your readiness for surgery. Your asthma and allergies remained managed with medications.

- **Age 45**: After gastric bypass surgery, you lost weight (from 312 to 200 lbs) but regained 20 lbs. You were diagnosed with high cholesterol (hyperlipidemia) and started atorvastatin. Asthma and GERD were stable. You were advised to follow a low-fat diet and exercise.

- **Age 60**: You experienced worsening knee pain (likely osteoarthritis) due to your weight history. You quit smoking and maintained a weight of 210 lbs. Medications for asthma, cholesterol, and GERD continued. You were prescribed naproxen for pain and referred to physical therapy. Knee X-rays were ordered.

**Key Points**:  
- **Diagnoses**: Asthma, seasonal allergies, obesity, hyperlipidemia, GERD, knee osteoarthritis.  
- **Medications**: Flovent, albuterol, cetirizine, atorvastatin, omeprazole, naproxen (as needed).  
- **Allergies**: Penicillin (rash).  
- **Surgeries**: Laparoscopic gastric bypass (age ~30).  
- **Lifestyle**: Former light smoker (quit at 55), minimal alcohol, history of weight struggles, now exercises regularly.  

**Recommended Specialist**: Rheumatologist (for knee osteoarthritis and ongoing joint pain management).

2025-06-08 14:38:42,020 - DEBUG - API response: **Medical History Summary for Patient_1:**

1. **Age 10**: You were diagnosed with asthma and seasonal allergies, triggered by dust. You had wheezing and coughing, especially at night. You were prescribed an albuterol inhaler (for quick relief), Flovent (daily control), and cetirizine (for allergies). No major surgeries or other health issues.  

2. **Age 20**: You gained weight (BMI 36, 220 lbs) and reported fatigue and knee pain. Asthma was under control with inhalers. No diabetes or high blood pressure. A nutritionist was recommended for weight management, along with exercise and lab tests to check for metabolic issues.  

3. **Age 30**: Your weight increased to 312 lbs, causing mobility issues (difficulty climbing stairs, walking). You explored weight-loss support groups and considered gastric banding surgery. Tests were ordered to evaluate your health for surgery. Asthma and allergies remained managed with medications.  

4. **Age 45**: After gastric bypass surgery, you lost weight (from 312 to 200 lbs) but regained 20 lbs. High cholesterol was detected (likely genetic and weight-related). You were started on atorvastatin and advised to follow a heart-healthy diet. Asthma and GERD were stable.  

5. **Age 60**: You developed knee osteoarthritis (pain, stiffness) due to long-term obesity. Weight was stable at 210 lbs post-surgery. Medications included atorvastatin, asthma inhalers, and pain relievers (naproxen). Physical therapy and knee X-rays were recommended.  

**Key Details**:  
- **Diagnoses**: Asthma, seasonal allergies, obesity, GERD, hyperlipidemia (high cholesterol), knee osteoarthritis.  
- **Surgeries**: Laparoscopic gastric bypass (age ~30).  
- **Medications**: Flovent, albuterol, cetirizine, omeprazole (for GERD), atorvastatin (for cholesterol), pain relievers (ibuprofen/naproxen).  
- **Allergies**: Penicillin (causes rash).  
- **Lifestyle**: Former light smoker (quit at 55), minimal alcohol, history of weight struggles.  

**Recommended Specialist**: Endocrinologist (for weight and metabolic management) or Orthopedic Surgeon (for knee osteoarthritis).

2025-06-08 14:41:49,908 - DEBUG - API response: ### Patient_2's Medical History Summary  

**Childhood (Age 8):**  
- Diagnosed with **generalized epilepsy** after experiencing two seizures.  
- Started on **levetiracetam** (250 mg twice daily, increased to 500 mg twice daily).  
- Tests (EEG, MRI) ruled out structural causes. Parents were educated on seizure safety.  

**Young Adulthood (Age 25):**  
- Developed confusion, slurred speech, and right-sided weakness after a flu-like illness.  
- Diagnosed with **moyamoya disease** (a rare condition affecting brain blood vessels) after MRI showed strokes in the brain.  
- **Cognitive and language difficulties** were noted. Continued **levetiracetam** for epilepsy.  

**Middle Age (Age 40):**  
- Underwent **urgent tracheostomy and stent removal** due to severe **tracheal stenosis** (narrowing of the windpipe) caused by earlier stent complications.  
- History of **moyamoya disease and epilepsy** remained stable.  

**Later Adulthood (Age 55):**  
- Developed symptoms of **obstructive sleep apnea** (snoring, fatigue), likely linked to tracheostomy.  
- **Moyamoya disease and epilepsy** were still under control. Sleep study (polysomnography) recommended.  

**Senior Years (Age 70):**  
- Heart evaluation showed **mild aortic valve stenosis, mitral valve issues, and pulmonary hypertension**.  
- Heart function was strong but with some stiffness and abnormal relaxation patterns.  

### Key Points:  
- **Chronic Conditions:** Epilepsy (controlled with levetiracetam), moyamoya disease, tracheal stenosis (post-tracheostomy), sleep apnea, and heart valve issues.  
- **Surgeries/Treatments:** Tracheostomy with stent removal (Age 40).  
- **Lifestyle:** Nonsmoker, minimal alcohol, stable weight.  

**Recommended Specialist:** **Neurologist (with expertise in moyamoya disease and epilepsy)**.

2025-06-08 14:46:42,198 - DEBUG - API response: **Medical History Summary for Patient_1:**  

- **Age 10:** You were diagnosed with asthma and seasonal allergies after experiencing wheezing and coughing, especially at night or around dust. You were prescribed an albuterol inhaler (for quick relief) and Flovent (a daily inhaler), along with cetirizine for allergies. You had no other health issues at the time.  

- **Age 20:** You began struggling with weight gain, reaching a BMI of 36 (220 lbs). Fatigue and mild knee pain were noted. Your asthma was under control with medications. A nutritionist was recommended for weight management, along with exercise and lab tests to check for metabolic issues.  

- **Age 30:** Your weight increased to 312 lbs, causing difficulty with daily activities like climbing stairs. You explored weight-loss support groups and considered gastric banding surgery. Tests were ordered to evaluate your eligibility for the procedure.  

- **Age 45:** After gastric bypass surgery at ~30, you lost significant weight (down to 200 lbs) but regained 20 lbs. High cholesterol was detected, likely due to family history and weight. You started atorvastatin and were advised dietary changes. Asthma and GERD remained stable.  

- **Age 60:** You now experience chronic knee pain (likely osteoarthritis), worsened by your weight history. You’ve quit smoking and maintain a weight of 210 lbs. Medications manage your asthma, cholesterol, and GERD. Knee X-rays and physical therapy were recommended.  

**Key Diagnoses:** Asthma, seasonal allergies, obesity (status post gastric bypass), GERD, hyperlipidemia, knee osteoarthritis.  
**Key Medications:** Flovent, albuterol, cetirizine, omeprazole, atorvastatin, NSAIDs (ibuprofen/naproxen).  
**Allergies:** Penicillin (rash).  
**Lifestyle:** Former light smoker (quit at 55), minimal alcohol, ongoing weight management efforts.  

**Recommended Specialist:** Rheumatologist (for osteoarthritis and joint pain management).

- **Age 45**: After gastric bypass surgery, you lost weight but regained some. You were diagnosed with high cholesterol and started on atorvastatin. Asthma and GERD were stable. Lifestyle changes and nutritionist follow-ups were recommended.  

- **Age 60**: You experienced knee pain due to osteoarthritis, likely from past obesity. You quit smoking, maintained weight (210 lbs), and managed asthma and cholesterol. Treatment included pain relief (naproxen), physical therapy, and knee X-rays.  

**Key Points**:  
- **Diagnoses**: Asthma, seasonal allergies, obesity (status post gastric bypass), GERD, hyperlipidemia, knee osteoarthritis.  
- **Medications**: Flovent, albuterol, cetirizine, omeprazole, atorvastatin, pain relievers (ibuprofen/naproxen).  
- **Allergies**: Penicillin (rash).  
- **Surgeries**: Laparoscopic gastric bypass (age ~30).  
- **Lifestyle**: Former light smoker, minimal alcohol, weight management efforts, exercise.  

**Recommended Specialist**: **Orthopedist** (for knee osteoarthritis management).

- **Age 8**: You were diagnosed with epilepsy after experiencing two seizures. You started taking levetiracetam (250 mg, later increased to 500 mg twice daily) and had tests like an EEG and MRI to confirm the diagnosis. No other health issues were noted.  

- **Age 25**: You developed confusion, slurred speech, and right-sided weakness. Tests revealed moyamoya disease, a rare condition affecting blood vessels in the brain, along with an old stroke. Your epilepsy was stable, and you continued levetiracetam.  

- **Age 40**: You had severe tracheal (windpipe) narrowing due to a previous stent, requiring emergency surgery to remove the stent and place a tracheostomy tube (breathing tube in the neck). Your moyamoya and epilepsy remained under control.  

- **Age 55**: You developed symptoms of sleep apnea (snoring, fatigue), likely related to your tracheostomy. A sleep study was recommended. Your moyamoya and epilepsy were stable.  

- **Age 70**: A heart test showed mild aortic valve narrowing, mild lung pressure issues, and other age-related heart changes, but no major heart disease.  

**Key Details**:  
- **Diagnoses**: Epilepsy (since age 8), moyamoya disease (since age 25), tracheal stenosis (age 40), sleep apnea (age 55), mild heart valve issues (age 70).  
- **Medications**: Levetiracetam (500 mg twice daily) for epilepsy.  
- **Surgeries**: Tracheostomy with stent removal (age 40).  
- **Allergies**: None.  
- **Lifestyle**: Nonsmoker, rare alcohol use.  

**Recommended Specialist**: **Neurologist (for epilepsy and moyamoya disease)**.

- **Age 10:** Diagnosed with asthma and seasonal allergies after experiencing wheezing and coughing, especially at night or around dust. Started using an albuterol inhaler (as needed) and Flovent (daily) to manage asthma, along with cetirizine for allergies. Allergic to penicillin (causes a rash). No other health issues.  

- **Age 20:** Struggled with obesity (BMI 36) and reported fatigue and knee pain. Asthma was under control with medications. Advised to work with a nutritionist, exercise regularly, and monitor for metabolic issues like high cholesterol or diabetes.  

- **Age 30:** Severe obesity (312 lbs) with difficulty performing daily activities. Explored weight loss support groups and considered laparoscopic gastric banding. Underwent evaluations for surgery, including mental health and pulmonary clearance. No other major health problems reported at this time.  

- **Age 45:** After gastric bypass surgery 15 years prior, weight dropped to 200 lbs but partially regained (220 lbs). Diagnosed with high cholesterol. Started atorvastatin and advised to follow a heart-healthy diet. Asthma and GERD remained stable.  

- **Age 60:** Experienced worsening knee pain due to osteoarthritis, likely linked to past obesity. Weight stable at 210 lbs post-surgery. Managed with NSAIDs (naproxen), physical therapy, and ongoing care for asthma and high cholesterol. Quit smoking 5 years ago.  

**Key Ongoing Issues:**  
- Asthma (controlled with Flovent/albuterol)  
- Seasonal allergies (cetirizine)  
- Obesity history (status post gastric bypass)  
- High cholesterol (atorvastatin)  
- Osteoarthritis (knees)  
- GERD (omeprazole)  

**Allergies:** Penicillin (rash).  

**Recommended Specialist:** **Rheumatologist** (for osteoarthritis management).

2025-06-08 15:11:01,643 - DEBUG - API response: Here’s a simple summary of your medical history:

**Age 8**: You were diagnosed with epilepsy after having two seizures. You started taking levetiracetam (250 mg, later increased to 500 mg twice daily) and had tests like an EEG and MRI to rule out other causes. No other health issues were noted.  

**Age 25**: You developed confusion, slurred speech, and right-sided weakness. Tests revealed moyamoya disease (a rare blood vessel disorder affecting the brain). You also had signs of a minor stroke. Your epilepsy was stable, and you continued levetiracetam.  

**Age 40**: You had severe narrowing of your windpipe (tracheal stenosis) due to a previous stent. This required emergency surgery to remove the stent and place a tracheostomy tube (breathing tube in the neck).  

**Age 55**: You developed symptoms of sleep apnea (snoring, daytime fatigue), likely related to your tracheostomy. Your moyamoya disease and epilepsy remained stable. A sleep study was recommended.  

**Age 70**: A heart exam showed mild aortic valve narrowing, mild mitral valve leakage, and high lung artery pressure. Your heart function was strong but overactive.  

**Key Details**:  
- **Diagnoses**: Epilepsy (since age 8), moyamoya disease (since age 25), tracheal stenosis (age 40), sleep apnea (age 55), and mild heart valve issues (age 70).  
- **Medications**: Levetiracetam (500 mg twice daily) for epilepsy.  
- **Surgeries**: Tracheostomy with stent removal (age 40).  
- **Allergies**: None.  
- **Lifestyle**: Nonsmoker, rare alcohol use.  

**Recommended Specialist**: Neurologist (for epilepsy and moyamoya disease follow-up).

2025-06-08 15:14:28,633 - DEBUG - API response: **Medical History Summary for Patient_1:**

- **Age 10**: Diagnosed with asthma and seasonal allergies after experiencing wheezing and coughing, especially at night or around dust. Started using an albuterol inhaler (as needed) and Flovent (daily) to manage asthma, along with cetirizine for allergies. Allergic to penicillin (causes rash). No surgeries. Family history of heart disease and diabetes.  

- **Age 20**: Struggled with obesity (BMI 36, 220 lbs), causing fatigue and knee pain. Asthma remained controlled with inhalers. Referred to a nutritionist for weight management and advised to exercise 150 minutes/week. No surgeries.  

- **Age 30**: Obesity worsened (312 lbs), with difficulty performing daily activities due to weight. Explored gastric banding surgery after evaluations (mental health, pulmonary, and lab tests). Asthma and allergies stable. Smoked lightly (<3 cigarettes/day).  

- **Age 45**: Underwent gastric bypass surgery 15 years prior, losing significant weight (from 312 to 200 lbs) but regained 20 lbs. Diagnosed with high cholesterol (familial + obesity-related). Started atorvastatin and continued asthma/allergy medications. Quit smoking.  

- **Age 60**: Developed knee osteoarthritis (pain, stiffness) likely due to past obesity. Maintained weight at 210 lbs post-surgery. Managed with naproxen, physical therapy, and ongoing medications for asthma, allergies, and cholesterol. Fully quit smoking 5 years prior.  

**Key Ongoing Issues**:  
- Asthma (controlled with Flovent/albuterol).  
- Seasonal allergies (cetirizine).  
- Obesity (status post gastric bypass).  
- High cholesterol (atorvastatin).  
- Knee osteoarthritis (managed with therapy/meds).  

**Allergies**: Penicillin (rash).  

**Recommended Specialist**: **Rheumatologist** (for osteoarthritis management).

2025-06-08 15:25:51,733 - DEBUG - API response: Here’s a summary of your medical history in simple terms:  

- **Age 15**: You were diagnosed with mild scoliosis (a slight curvature of the spine) during a school screening. No major symptoms, just occasional back pain. You were advised to do physical therapy and monitor the curvature with X-rays. No treatment was needed at the time.  

- **Age 30**: You developed hypothyroidism (an underactive thyroid), causing fatigue, weight gain, and feeling cold. You started taking levothyroxine (50 mcg daily) to manage it. Your scoliosis remained stable.  

- **Age 45**: You were diagnosed with high blood pressure (hypertension). You began taking amlodipine (5 mg daily) and were advised to eat less salt and exercise. Your hypothyroidism was well-controlled with levothyroxine (dose increased to 75 mcg).  

- **Age 60**: You fractured your wrist after a minor fall, and a bone scan showed osteoporosis (weak bones). You started alendronate (70 mg weekly), calcium, and vitamin D to strengthen your bones. Your other conditions (hypertension, hypothyroidism, scoliosis) were stable.  

- **Age 80**: Your heart function was normal, with no major issues. You continued managing osteoporosis, hypothyroidism, and hypertension with medications.  

**Key Details**:  
- **Diagnoses**: Scoliosis (mild, stable), hypothyroidism, hypertension, osteoporosis.  
- **Medications**: Levothyroxine (thyroid), amlodipine (blood pressure), alendronate (osteoporosis), calcium, vitamin D.  
- **Allergies/Surgeries**: None.  
- **Lifestyle**: Nonsmoker, minimal alcohol, generally active.  

**Recommended Specialist**: Endocrinologist (for thyroid and bone health management).

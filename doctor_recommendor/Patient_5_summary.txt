Hereâ€™s a summary of your medical history in simple terms:  

- **Age 15**: You were diagnosed with mild scoliosis (a slight curvature of the spine) during a school screening. No major symptoms, just occasional back pain. You were advised to do physical therapy and monitor the curvature with X-rays. No treatment was needed at the time.  

- **Age 30**: You developed hypothyroidism (an underactive thyroid), causing fatigue, weight gain, and feeling cold. You started taking levothyroxine (50 mcg daily) to manage it. Your scoliosis remained stable.  

- **Age 45**: You were diagnosed with high blood pressure (hypertension). You began taking amlodipine (5 mg daily) and were advised to eat less salt and exercise. Your hypothyroidism was well-controlled with levothyroxine (dose increased to 75 mcg).  

- **Age 60**: You fractured your wrist after a minor fall, and a bone scan showed osteoporosis (weak bones). You started alendronate (70 mg weekly), calcium, and vitamin D to strengthen your bones. Your other conditions (hypertension, hypothyroidism, scoliosis) were stable.  

- **Age 80**: Your heart function was normal, with no major issues. You continued managing osteoporosis, hypothyroidism, and hypertension with medications.  

**Key Details**:  
- **Diagnoses**: Scoliosis (mild, stable), hypothyroidism, hypertension, osteoporosis.

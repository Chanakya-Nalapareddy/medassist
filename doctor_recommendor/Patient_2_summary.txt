Hereâ€™s a simple summary of your medical history:

**Age 8**: You were diagnosed with epilepsy after having two seizures. You started taking levetiracetam (250 mg, later increased to 500 mg twice daily) and had tests like an EEG and MRI to rule out other causes. No other health issues were noted.  

**Age 25**: You developed confusion, slurred speech, and right-sided weakness. Tests revealed moyamoya disease (a rare blood vessel disorder affecting the brain). You also had signs of a minor stroke. Your epilepsy was stable, and you continued levetiracetam.  

**Age 40**: You had severe narrowing of your windpipe (tracheal stenosis) due to a previous stent. This required emergency surgery to remove the stent and place a tracheostomy tube (breathing tube in the neck).  

**Age 55**: You developed symptoms of sleep apnea (snoring, daytime fatigue), likely related to your tracheostomy. Your moyamoya disease and epilepsy remained stable. A sleep study was recommended.  

**Age 70**: A heart exam showed mild aortic valve narrowing, mild mitral valve leakage, and high lung artery pressure. Your heart function was strong but overactive.  

**Key Details**:  
- **Diagnoses**: Epilepsy (since age 8), moyamoya disease (since age 25), tracheal stenosis (age 40), sleep apnea (age 55), and mild heart valve issues (age 70).  
- **Medications**: Levetiracetam (500 mg twice daily) for epilepsy.  
- **Surgeries**: Tracheostomy with stent removal (age 40).  
- **Allergies**: None.  
- **Lifestyle**: Nonsmoker, rare alcohol use.  

**Recommended Specialist**: Neurologist (for epilepsy and moyamoya disease follow-up).

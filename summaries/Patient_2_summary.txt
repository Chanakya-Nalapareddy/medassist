Early Childhood  
At age 8, Patient_2 was diagnosed with new-onset generalized epilepsy. Assessments included EEG confirmation of seizure activity and MRI brain to rule out structural causes. Management included levetiracetam initiation and parental education on seizure safety.  

Adolescence  
No relevant data.  

Adulthood  
By age 25, Patient_2 developed Moyamoya disease with cognitive and language impairments. Levetiracetam 500 mg BID was continued. At age 40, severe subglottic tracheal stenosis with airway obstruction necessitated neck exploration, tracheostomy, and bronchoscopy for foreign body removal.  

Recent Hospitalization  
No recent hospitalization noted.  

Current Medications  
- Levetiracetam 500 mg BID  

Allergies  
None reported.  

Social History  
Lives with parents at age 8; nonsmoker with rare alcohol use as an adult. Retired engineer by age 55.

Key Assessments  
- Age 8: New-onset generalized epilepsy  
- Age 25: Moyamoya disease, cognitive dysfunction, impaired language  
- Age 40: Airway obstruction due to tracheal stenosis  
- Age 55: Suspected obstructive sleep apnea, stable Moyamoya disease and epilepsy  
- Age 70: Mild aortic valve stenosis, mitral regurgitation, pulmonary artery hypertension, patent foramen ovale  

Key Plans  
- Age 8: EEG, MRI brain, levetiracetam titration, seizure safety education  
- Age 25: Discharged on levetiracetam  
- Age 40: Surgical airway management  
- Age 55: Polysomnography, CPAP trial counseling, weight maintenance  

Summary  
Patient_2 has a complex medical history including epilepsy, Moyamoya disease, and tracheal stenosis, managed with levetiracetam and prior surgical interventions. Recent assessments note cardiovascular abnormalities and stable neurological conditions. Ongoing monitoring is advised.
